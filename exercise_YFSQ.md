# Exercise - PREFIX, SELECT, WHERE

## Your task

Write a SPARQL query that displays the first and last names of all characters in the data.

Use the workspace below to draft your sparql query using PREFIX, SELECT, and WHERE.

{% raw  %}
~~~~
PREFIX GOT: <https://tutorial.linked.data.world/d/sparqltutorial/>
~~~~
{% endraw  %}

## Having trouble?


Review the [Your First SPARQL Query](./Your_First_Sparql_Query.md) section and pay particular attention to the variables `?ID` and `?FName` and how the SPARQL query fills those with the correct values using their associated property names for each resource. Remember, a query should follow the same format as an RDF data statement: `{ Resource propertyName propertyValue }`
